# Finite-Automata-Simulation
here we test different processes with Deterministic Finite Automata and Nondeterministic Finite Automata.

Imagine two dancers on a grand stage: Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). DFA is a precise conductor, 
following strict rules with unyielding determination. NFA, on the other hand, is an artistic performer, embracing ambiguity and exploring multiple possibilities. 
Together, they form the graceful symphony of Automatas, decoding languages and captivating the realm of computation with their elegant dance.
